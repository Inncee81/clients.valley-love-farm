                            Our chickens and pigs are pasture-raised, which means they are allowed to roam the fields,
                            eating the insects and plants they would naturally eat. Happy animals means meat and eggs
                            with higher Omega-3s and Vitamins A, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, D, and E.
